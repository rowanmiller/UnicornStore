  /* These are just placeholders to show the settings required to enable authentication
     For security reasons I would not put your actual credentials in here since you may
     inadvertently check them into source control etc. 
  
     For my local development I have a secrets.json file which is included in .gitignore
     to ensure it is never checked in. You'll see secrets.json included as an optional
     config file at the top of startup.cs. Since config follows a last-registered-wins
     policy the values in secrets.json just override the placeholders here.

     Here's where to create your own credentials to enable auth:
      - Google: https://console.developers.google.com/project
      - Facebook: https://developers.facebook.com/apps

     Make sure you list http://localhost:5000 as a valid address for the auth accounts
     you create since that is where the site will be hosted when you run it locally.
